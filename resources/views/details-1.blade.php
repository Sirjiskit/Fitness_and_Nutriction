                            Everyone's training goals are different, but if you want to get stronger, you're probably going to want to get familiar with the best barbell exercises.

                        <p>
                            You can build strength faster thanks to how easy barbells make compound movements â€” exercises where you use more than one muscle group at a time. (Think: squats, where you engage your core, quads, hamstrings, glutes, calf muscles and hip flexors to perform the exercise.)

                                Perform each exercise for the number of sets and reps listed below. Rest 30 to 60 seconds between sets and between each exercise.

                            Fix the weight plates on your barbell (optional) and position it on the floor in front of you.

                        <p>
                            Stand with your feet hip-distance apart and place the barbell behind your head, sitting on your trap muscles (the muscles at the top of your shoulders).
